        <p style=" font-size:20px; text-align:center; font-family: 'Amatic SC'"> I am a recent Information Technology graduate at the associate level with a focus in Software Developement as a carreer.
            I graduated with my associates in early May,2020. Shortly after graduating, I enrolled with Per Scholas' Java
            Developer Training Course. While with Per Scholas I have been able to build on and expand my knowledge as a Full
            Stack Developer. Thanks to my training i have been able to fully build this blog from scratch which is not bad
            for my first actual project which is an incredible sign of better things to come. When i am not on the computer
            programming and building on my knowledge I am out with loved ones. You can pretty much always find me outside
            if im not on the computer. I love to take bike rides, swim, hike and just appreciate all that nature has to offer.
